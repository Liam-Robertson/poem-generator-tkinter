<text>'Whose side', she sighed, 'Would you be on ?
And smiled. 'The perpetrator
Never signed his snide remark
On the woman it was sired on. See ?'
She showed her hand. 'Your name
Is not there.' - 'Who would put
His hand to an unsized canvas ?
Slide-thrift. Your move.'

A man she should have taken in her stride,
A self-styled master, scythed her self-
Esteem in this po-faced
Pyjama tango.</text>
