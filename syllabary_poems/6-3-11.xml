<text>We've got falls to write about; they don't:
They thought up fauns: viagra with the hoofs and horns of bambi.
Whoever faas is deid, no drunk.
Their flaws are divinely crafted.
It's slaves the guidwife flogs, not wedding china.
Frogs are frogs: they don't get pawned for princes.
Passion fogs the reason, not the glasses.
The last act hits the hero, however he fobs it off,
Whereas, here, a lawyer foils the fates like chicken
If you pay so. Their forms are platonic; ours are electronic.</text>
