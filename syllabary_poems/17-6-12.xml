<title>Quince Jelly and a Packet of Crisps
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Quirks of Squatland
Quiffs of fall, sheer
Numbdom. Call it quits.
Kilts and quilts and travelling rugs
On troubling clits, it's
Lazing on a sunny
Afternoon to get my kicks in catnaps.

Stood there seeing our shoes
Four canvas shoes at the London bus stop.
The smaller toes turn in, the heels
Lift as ae fond peck she puts
To the puckered brow.
Yesterday, on the internet,
I found she'd married a
Hotshot lawyer twenty-five
Years ago.</text>
