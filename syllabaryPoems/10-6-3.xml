<text>The baby could say uno
Due, tre in good Italian
But still said cheese for trees;
I now hear why.
The tr is ch, but said with the tip
Instead of blade on dental ridge ;
A separate R - t-rue - is bold italic.
Otherwise an individual
sound but for the faint
Retroflexion, the sliding fall
To drip drap drape dreep drop droop
Even drupe, the chosen fruit,
While dip gets only deep,
Dark on the water.</text>
