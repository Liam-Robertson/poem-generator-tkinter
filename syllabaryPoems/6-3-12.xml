<text>Though I am false,
My faults are real
Flaughts of colour in the eye.
Stone fonts.
This sound foists a certain amount of froth on the announcement
With a lot that's very old and strong: frosts,
Frocks - the pent-up energy of first, formal encounters,
Flocks that enfold their enemy, cops in the crops.
It's murder polis, Cain or Abel, crooks or forks.
Flops are neither here nor there,
Decreed as they are by fops and feedback.
I change my ways, but bear in mind: a fox is a fox.</text>
