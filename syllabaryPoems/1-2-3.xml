<title>"And winking mary buds begin"
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>If, at primary school, you were made to sing "Hark, hark, the lark"
And taught that its author was "maybe the greatest bard that ever lived"
But haven't yet gone off the way of the words,
Then either there was a lot of weight on "maybe",
Or you reckoned you could dunt him off his plinth,
Or maybe, friend, you know when to listen to the singer
And when to the song.</text>
