<text>The fruits of the mulberry
Flutes of baroque
The flukes of desire
That Ahab is trying to harpoon.
It's like shooting back at Cupid
Stupid

A clonic assembly of Fausts
In the founts of banality frowsts
And it flouts the convention
Of thought and intent. Figures
Flouse. And they frounce and they flounce.</text>
