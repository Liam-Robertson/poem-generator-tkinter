<text>Off Edinburgh the bops as bees wot throws,
and cries wot ay, &apos;Heir chums our awn quire Clerk!&apos;
than fleas dhow like an owlet chest with crawls,
quill bishops at thy botanist DOS bark:
than carillons cries, &apos;Keep churches in the murk,
our gallons gamps; lo! quasi a grackles gays.&apos;
A tughrik shays, &apos;I see him want a shark,
I read you, chukker, take in your lynching slays.&apos;
